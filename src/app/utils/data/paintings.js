        introduction: "Perburuan Banteng (Banteng Hunt) is a painting by Raden Saleh, a famous Indonesian artist who studied art in Europe in the 19th century. The painting depicts a hunting scene of wild bulls in a grassland with six mounted hunters, one of whom is a self-portrait of Raden Saleh. The painting was commissioned by a wealthy French merchant, Jules Stanislas Sigisbert Cézard, in 1850 and was auctioned off in 1859. The painting was rediscovered in a cellar in France in 2017 and was sold for 7.2 million euros (about 8.8 million USD) in 2018 to an anonymous Indonesian collector. The painting is considered a masterpiece of Raden Saleh and a symbol of Indonesian national pride.",

              "The composition of Raden Saleh's Perburuan Banteng (Banteng Hunt) is a dynamic and dramatic depiction of a traditional Javanese hunting scene. The painting shows six mounted hunters, one of whom is a self-portrait of Raden Saleh, chasing and spearing wild bulls in a grassland with alang-alang (tall grass). The painting uses a diagonal perspective to create a sense of movement and tension, as the hunters and the bulls are positioned at different angles and distances. The painting also uses contrast and color to highlight the main subjects and create a focal point. The hunters wear bright red and white clothing, while the bulls have dark brown and black fur. The background is mostly green and yellow, with some blue sky and clouds.
